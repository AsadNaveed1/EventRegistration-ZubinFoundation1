A comprehensive event registration and management system built with Django (backend) and React (frontend) for the Zubin Foundation, designed to facilitate event management, volunteer coordination, and participant engagement with integrated AI chatbot assistance.

The Event Registration System is designed to streamline event management for the Zubin Foundation, which focuses on improving the lives of Hong Kong's ethnic minorities. The platform supports three user types: Administrators, Volunteers, and Participants, each with tailored functionality to manage events, appointments, and training materials. The system includes an AI-powered chatbot assistant to help users with event registration, training materials, and event details.

This project was developed during the Morgan Stanley Code to Give Hackathon, where it was awarded 2nd Runner-Up.
